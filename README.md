# Phishing Website Detection System

## Overview

This project is a **Phishing Website Detection System** built using **React**. The system allows users to input a website URL and determines whether the website is potentially harmful (phishing) or safe. The tool provides a simple and intuitive interface for checking websites against basic rules and patterns commonly associated with phishing attempts.

## Features

- **URL Input**: Users can input a website URL to check its safety.
- **Phishing Detection**: The system checks for suspicious patterns in the URL (e.g., common phishing keywords like "login", "verify", etc.) and highlights whether the website is safe or potentially a phishing website.
- **Results Display**: Results are displayed in a color-coded box (Green for Safe, Red for Bad) along with a typing animation for a dynamic experience.
- **Guidance Section**: Provides tips and rules for users to recognize fake or phishing websites.
- **Responsive**: Fully responsive design that works seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices.
- **Footer**: Includes developer information, college details, and social media links.

## Installation

To get started with this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/phishing-detection-system.git
    ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd phishing-detection-system
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   Your application will now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building the interactive user interface.
- **Bootstrap**: Styling framework used for responsive design and UI components.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core programming language used for logic and functionality.
- **CSS**: Custom styles for creating the modern and professional design.
- **React Hooks**: Used for managing state (`useState`, `useEffect`).

## How It Works

1. **URL Analysis**: When a user enters a website URL, the application parses the URL and looks for common phishing indicators such as:
   - Long URLs
   - Phishing keywords in the URL (like 'login', 'account', etc.)
   - Suspicious patterns such as too many hyphens or numbers in the domain name.
   
2. **Result Display**: Based on the analysis, the system will either display a message indicating that the website is "Good" or "Bad" (potentially a phishing site). The results are color-coded:
   - **Green**: Safe Website
   - **Red**: Suspicious/Phishing Website

3. **Information Section**: Provides users with additional tips on how to recognize phishing websites, including:
   - Checking the URL for security.
   - Avoiding suspicious pop-ups.
   - Looking for trust indicators like the padlock symbol in the address bar.
